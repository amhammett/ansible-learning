inventory | static basics
=========================

There are times where it's more convenient to start with a static inventory.

This example includes two hosts groups found within `./inventory/hosts`, `web` and `db`. Playbooks
have been defined to reference these host groups

A `Makefile` has been created to simplify the running of playbooks.
