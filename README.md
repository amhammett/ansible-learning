Ansible-Learning
================

The purpose of this repository is to provide direction and examples to assist
with Ansible learning.

### Reading Resources

Before you begin you will want to read up on [YAML syntax](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html).

There are a lot of resources online. I primarily use the [ansible docs](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html)
to reference ansible. It lists infomration on [playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html)
and [modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html).

There are also [example playbooks](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples)
which provides information on common setup.
